# Personal Finance Tracker in C++

## Overview

The **Personal Finance Tracker** is a C++ application that allows users to manage their expenses and savings. The program lets you add expenses, view a list of expenses, manage savings by setting goals and adding funds, and generate a financial report that shows total expenses, savings, and the savings goal.

The application uses C++ and its built-in libraries to create a simple, user-friendly experience for tracking personal finances.

## Features

- **Add Expense**: Allows users to add new expenses with details like name, amount, category, and date.
- **View Expenses**: Displays the list of all recorded expenses.
- **Manage Savings**: Set a savings goal, and add funds to your savings.
- **Generate Report**: Displays the total expenses, total savings, and compares the savings with the goal.

## Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later (e.g., **g++**, **clang++**).
- **macOS**, **Linux**, or **Windows** (with a suitable development environment like MinGW or Cygwin).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository (or download the `finance.cpp` file).
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Kodedbykenzie/finance-tracker.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```
   cd Personal-Finance-Tracker
   ```

3. Compile the program using a C++ compiler. Make sure to use the **C++11** standard or later.
   ```
   g++ -std=c++11 finance.cpp -o finance
   ```

4. After successful compilation, run the program:
   ```
   ./finance
   ```

1. **Add Expense**: Add a new expense by providing a name, amount, category, and date.
2. **View Expenses**: View all expenses that have been added so far.
3. **Manage Savings**: Set a savings goal and add funds to your savings.
4. **Generate Report**: View a report showing total expenses, current savings, and your savings goal.
5. **Exit**: Exit the application.
